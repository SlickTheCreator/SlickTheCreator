# Hello, I'm Tevin Thomas üñêüèæ

I'm a computer science student with grand aspirations, dedicated to honing my skills in web development and delving into the realms of data analytics, data engineering, and machine learning. My ultimate goal is to become a software engineer or even a Machine Learning Engineer. Currently pursuing my BS in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University.
My passion lies in crafting high-quality code and continually expanding my technical expertise. The idea of joining a dynamic team of developers, where we create innovative products and gain hands-on experience, truly excites me. I possess a strong foundation in languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript, along with proficiency in frameworks such as React and Node.js. In the data analysis realm, I'm well-versed in Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, excelling in exploratory data analysis, visualization, modeling, and algorithm implementation. I've also ventured into machine learning, developing models using sklearn and achieving impressive accuracy through meticulous parameter tuning and cross-validation.
Beyond programming, I find joy in playing football, diving into books, and tuning into podcasts. I'm always eager for stimulating conversations and outdoor adventures, embracing a wide range of interests.
