 I've been fascinated by technology and programming from a young age, especially the possibilities of artificial intelligence. This has lead me to pursuing my passion at Southern New Hampshire University as a computer science major with a specialization in machine learning. I spent my early years studying computer science fundamentals - algorithms, data structures, databases, and more. But I'm most excited by advanced AI concepts like neural networks and natural language processing. I've already built simple machine learning models using Python that can recognize handwritten digits and make basic predictions. However, I'm just scratching the surface of what's possible.

Outside of class, I continue sharpening my skills through independent learning. I've built web applications using frameworks like Django and Flask to improve my programming techniques. Of course, version control with Git allows me to manage it all. But my projects outside of class are where things really get interesting

After graduation, I hope to obtain a software engineering or data science role focused on machine learning. I'm eager to tackle new challenges and make impactful contributions to the field. My journey studying computer science and AI has only just begun. I can't wait to see where it will take me next.
