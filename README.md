 Tevin Thomas - 
I'm an ambitious computer science student eager to leverage my technical skills and experience to kickstart my career as a software engineer. Currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University while actively seeking internship and new grad opportunities starting June 2023.
I'm passionate about crafting high-quality code and learning new technologies. Excited by the opportunity to join a motivated team of developers, build innovative products, and gain hands-on experience while expanding my skills. Bringing strong foundations in languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript as well as frameworks like React and Node.js. In data analysis, I am proficient in Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and have experience performing exploratory data analysis, visualizations, modeling, and algorithm implementation. I have developed machine learning models using sklearn and achieved high accuracy through parameter tuning and cross-validation.
Eager to take on new challenges and make meaningful contributions as an intern or new graduate hire! Outside of programming, I enjoy playing basketball, reading, and listening to podcasts. Always down for thought-provoking conversations and hiking adventures!
Please feel free to contact me to discuss opportunities further. I'm excited to bring my skills, passion, and diligent work ethic to make an impact as a software engineer.
